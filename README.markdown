# README for Activator-Spark-SQL

This [Activator](http://typesafe.com/activator) template gets you up and running with the new [Spark SQL](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) API for integrating SQL queries on structured data into Spark applications.

It picks up where my "Activator-Spark" template left off.

See the [tutorial](tutorial/README.md) for details.
